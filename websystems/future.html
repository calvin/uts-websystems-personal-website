                <h1>What do I want to get out of my degree?</h1>
                <p>
                    More Money... maybe; I actually just want to get better at software development, software design and gain a deeper understanding of how "things" work so I can be better at my Job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from that, there has been this push lately (well in larger companies anyway) for Systems Administrators to do more development work to 'shift left' tasks that they or another team would do, to another team or make the task self service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of you may remember the devops craze (it's still happening wooh) which could be summed up in most companies as "get an ops guy and a developer for the price of one," or in others as "support for developers."<br/>
                    So really what I'm getting at, is that I can see that in 5 - 10 years time the traditional operations roles might not exist the way we know them today and I'd like to have both a very marketable skill set, and the piece of paper to back it up.

                <h1>Am I Going to Make the Switch to Linux and Java?</h1>
                <p>
                    Maybe, for Money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still prefer writing code in C# (you can now do development using .NET Core and host on linux anyway) as it's cleaner and far less verbose than Java (c# having type inference, etc.).<br/>
                    Maybe in the future I'll pick up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> and make the jump but for the time being I'm happy where I am, but money is... well money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from development work, another thing that keeps me from making the jump back to linux is PowerShell.<br/>
                    Honestly with the latest version (and really from version 3.0 and above) there is really no better scripting language for administrative purposes, sure it's available on Linux now via PowerShell 6.0 .NET Core but it's not quite as fully feature complete 5.0.x targeting full .NET.<br/>
                    If you're interested in Powershell, look up powershell in a month of lunches, books by Don Jones, or anything by Ed Wilson or Lee Holmes (Powershell cookbook).

                <h1>Outside of My Degree and Work, What Else?</h1>
                <p>
                    There are a few things I want to start doing / get back into.
                    I want to get back into Hiking again, nothing crazy maybe 3 – 7 day hikes, I miss how both quiet and loud the bush is at times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to start doing Home Automation, maybe further in the future when I own my own home (funny joke in Sydney right), I might start with things that more portable or I can work on projects at work as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than that, I don’t know what else I want to do in the future really, I mean in 6 months’ time I could change my mind or want to do something different. It’s why my most hated question is “What do you want to do in the future?” and why I disliked making this page, I normally answer in interviews that I'll probably be working elsewhere /s.
