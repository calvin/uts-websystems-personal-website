            <h1>My Super Exciting Past /s</h1>
            <span class="short-underline"></span>
            <p>
                My past isn’t particularly spectacular, let’s get that out of the way off the bat.
                December 1999 my family moved into housing commission, living in Willmot, NSW and I lived there for the next 13 years when I was forced to move out into my own place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early 2014 I moved next door to my then girlfriend, now wife, and went to TAFE to study IT, I couldn’t afford UNI so TAFE was the accessible option (when you could do a Diploma for $720, 2015 is when the price jumped, thanks libs).
            </p>
            <p>
                I finished my studies at TAFE and then entered the workforce working on the Helpdesk, I automated a few tasks using PowerShell to make my job easier and then with those skills I moved into my next role as a Support Engineer doing lvl 1 and lvl 2 support work. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                I continued to refine my scripting skills and after 6 months I moved over to Expedia as a Junior sysadmin. Using my Scripting skills I automated a few administrative processes, and tasks but what really made me move into my current role was building Go.
            </p>
            <p>
                What’s Go, eh it’s a super simple C# MVC Web Application that process Host Header redirection and redirections e.g. if a user navigates to “http://servicenow/” internally they are taken to “https://[our service now instance].service-now.com” and if they go to “http://servicenow/hr” they are redirected to the Human Resources Service Now Portal instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may think it’s not needed in this day and age, but when you have 20,000 users who all store their documentation across 3 – 6 online locations, it’s easier to remember http://[TeamName]/[Document or Project] than https://[Splunk link with 500 character query string].

                            In my time here I replaced 2 redirection services (redirect (host header redirection), and Go (YoURLS)) with a self-service portal that I developed called “Go!” which allowed users to create base level redirection (host header redirection) and short URLs off of those host header redirections without having to contact the helpdesk team, or in the case of host header redirections, my team.
