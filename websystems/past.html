                <h2>My Super Exciting Past /s</h2>
                <p> 
                    My past isn’t particularly spectacular, let’s get that out of the way off the bat.</br>
                    From memory in December 1999 my family moved into a housing commission residence, living in Willmot, NSW and I lived there for the next 13 years when I was told to move out.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Early 2014 I moved next door to my then girlfriend, now wife, and went to TAFE to study IT, I couldn’t afford to attend university at the time so TAFE was the next best thing (when you could do a Diploma for $720, 2015 is when the price jumped, thanks to the conservative Liberal state government back then).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I finished my studies, getting a Diploma and Certificate 4 of IT in networking, and then entered the workforce working on the helpdesk for Zurich Financial Services Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Zurich, I moved onto Stratton Finance as a Support Engineer (fancy title for helpdesk / desktop support) where I got to cut my teeth automating tasks (even if they were my own personal ones), I didn’t really enjoy working here and I soon left.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    After Stratton, I started working for Expedia as an Associate Systems Administrator supporting the corporate environment’s windows servers and any services we provided to internal end users.</br>
                    Here I automated quite a number of tasks using PowerShell scripts, orchestrator runbooks, and shifted left the task of creating host header and short URL redirections to end users by developing a self-service web portal called “Go! &copy”.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    On November 2, 2017, I married my Wife in the Botanical gardens up at Mount Tomah and then we went on a 2-week honeymoon on Hamilton Island.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Recently, due to my automation efforts and the creation of “Go! &copy”  I was promoted to a Systems Administrator.   
                </p>

                                    <br/>
                                    In my time here I replaced 2 redirection services (redirect (host header redirection), and Go (YoURLS)) with a self-service portal that I developed called “Go!” which allowed users to create base level redirection (host header redirection) and short URLs off of those host header redirections without having to contact the helpdesk team, or in the case of host header redirections, my team.
